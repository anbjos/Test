Even with a relatively simple transformer network, excellent performance can be achieved in real-world scenarios, as illustrated by the following example. Using the challenging task of separating human speech from background noise (e.g., frog sounds), the network demonstrates its robustness. Specifically:

1. **Signal with Noise** (Figure 1): This represents the input noisy speech signal, containing both human speech and frog sounds.
